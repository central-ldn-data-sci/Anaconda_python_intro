# Anaconda_python_intro
Intro to Anaconda, environments, python etc

*"All our meetups are equal, but some of our meetups are more equal than others."* 

This year we have had a real variety of meetup topics, that have looked at a range of different problems both in R and in Python. However, one of the hardest problem we've found is trying to design meetups that everyone can quickly get into, which has often been due to difficulties in standardising the software environments that we have been using. This meetup we hope to address this.

In this repo is an example notebook that you can use to demonstrate some basic python use, how to import packages via conda, and some data import and plotting. To follow the notebook it makes more sense to view the intro video that will be uploaded after the meetup, which introduces Anaconda, environments, and jupyter installation etc.

Video has now been uploaded and be downloaded here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0-wM-jL1G-SSll3WGI3X2RmcUk/view?usp=sharing). Apologies for the poor sound recording and irritating mouse click sounds. Next time will have a microphone attached and no mouseclicks to make it much more enjoyable. But main thing to take away is how Anaconda navigator can be used to create new environments, install packages within that environment, launch jupyter notebooks and write code.
